# Final Project Machine Learning Model Development Workflow
# Data set used: Framingham Heart Study Data set 
# Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# -Understanding the data structure and distribution 
# 1.1 Explore the data set and data types 
# -Perform metadata operation to make the data suitable for further analysis
# 1.2 Explore Issues in the Data 
# -Check for duplicates 
# -Check for missing values 
# -Check for distribution of the target variable
# -Explore to detect the presence of outliers(extreme values) 
# 1.3 Data Analysis 
# -Descriptive Statistics (summary statistics of features)
# -Univariate Analysis (distribution of features) 
# -Bivariate Analysis (relationship between features and target)
# -Multivariate Analysis (relationship between multiple features)
# Step 2: Splitting the data set and Data Preparation for Modeling 
# 2.1 Split the data set (training/validation/testing)
# 2.2 Data Cleaning (Handling missing values)
# 2.3 Data Pre-processing 
# -Handling outliers
# -Handling target imbalance
# Step 3: Model Development 
# -Train model using training Set
# -Evaluate model using validation Set
# -Hyperparameter tuning (Cross Validation)
# -Retrain model with best hyperparameters found (class weights)
# Step 4: Model Evaluation 
# -Evaluate model using testing set 
# -Compare models and select the best model using appropriate metrics

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
